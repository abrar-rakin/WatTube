# WatTube

Learning about pointers and memory management in first year was not easy. I often
had to ask my seniors for resources for learning these confusing concepts. There are just so
many resources available on the internet that it was easy to get overwhelmed and not know
which one to follow. Many of my friends faced the same problem too. Over time, I accumulated
all the resources that my friends and seniors suggested, and made WatTube to share those
resources with my juniors. WatTube saves your time by curating the best resources all in one
place, without needing to dig through the web
